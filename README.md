# Hey there 👋

I'm Rishabh, a frontend developer and designer based in Lucknow, India.

I build web applications with React and TypeScript. If an idea pops into my head, I'll design it in Figma, build it, and ship it.

Right now I'm working on an **Intelligent E-Tender Management System** — a full-stack project that I'm building end-to-end and making open source.

My main tech stack is React, TypeScript, JavaScript, and I'm learning backend development (Node.js, databases, authentication). For design, I use Figma to create UI/UX prototypes before writing code.

I build in public. Everything I'm learning and building is on GitHub.

## What I'm Up To

- Building the E-Tender Management System (full-stack, open source)
- Designing UI/UX prototypes in Figma
- Learning React.js, TypeScript, and Backend development
- Pushing code daily and documenting the journey

## Fun Facts

- One Piece is my favorite anime
- Love watching movies and anime in my free time
- Hit the gym regularly
- Enjoy traveling and trekking when I get the chance
